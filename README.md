## Pomodoro

Pomodoro is a time management technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length.

Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that the technique's creator used as a university student.
